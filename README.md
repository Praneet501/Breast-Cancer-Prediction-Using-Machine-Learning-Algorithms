Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project focuses on diagnosing breast cancer effectively using machine learning algorithms while emphasizing the importance of early detection and accurate tumor classification to improve prognosis and survival rates. The Cancer Wisconsin diagnostic dataset has been chosen for analysis, and the project aims to use five different algorithms for classification: RandomForestClassifier, SupportVectorMachine, DecisionTree, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic regression.

The main objective is to compare the accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices of these algorithms. The study aims to identify the most crucial characteristics for predicting whether a cancer is malignant or benign. Additionally, the project aims to contribute to the development of preventative, screening, and treatment programs by analyzing the relationships between variables in health-related data.

Breast cancer has a significant impact on individuals, especially women, and early detection is crucial for improved outcomes. The project's findings are expected to benefit clinicians, scientists, and healthcare experts by providing valuable insights for more effective diagnosis and treatment. The project builds on existing research and aims to be a reliable resource for identifying current needs in breast cancer research.
